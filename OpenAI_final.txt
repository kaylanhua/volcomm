Requirement: Advance privacy
OpenAI has taken several steps to advance privacy since the beginning of 2023:

1. **Encryption and Access Controls**: OpenAI encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), and uses strict access controls to limit who can access data.
2. **Data Ownership and Control**: OpenAI emphasizes that users own and control their data, with no training on business data by default. Users also control how long their data is retained and decide who has access.
3. **Security Audits**: OpenAI has been audited for SOC 2 compliance for ChatGPT Enterprise and API, ensuring comprehensive compliance with security standards.
4. **Consumer Privacy Management**: Users can manage their data by controlling whether they contribute to future model improvements in their settings. Temporary chats are not used to train models, and customer data is not used to train models by default.
5. **Privacy Policy Updates**: OpenAI has updated its privacy policy to include clearer information about data processing, retention, and user rights, such as the right to know, request deletion, correct, and be free from certain practices.

These measures highlight OpenAI's commitment to advancing privacy and security in its services.
